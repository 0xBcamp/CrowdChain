# CrowdChain

## Architecture

The CrowdChain smart contract consists of the following components:

1. Funding Contract: This smart contract manages the crowdfunding process, including creating the campaign accepting campaign  contributions,  and keeping track of the total amount raised.

2. Milestone Tracking: The smart contract can incorporate milestone tracking to release funds to the beneficiary at predetermined project completion stages. This ensures accountability and helps build trust between the project beneficiary and contributors.

3. Contribution Tracking: The contract records individual contributions, allowing contributors to be adequately acknowledged and ensuring transparency.

4. Refund Mechanism: If the funding goal is not reached within a specified timeframe, the smart contract can include a refund mechanism to return contributions to individual contributors.
